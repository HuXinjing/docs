# Concept Explanation

## User Types

In the OpenIM system, users are categorized into three types: **Regular User**, **APP Administrator**, and **Notification Account**.

### Regular User

- **Components**: `userID`, `faceURL`, `nickname`, `ex`
- **Description**: Regular users are typically imported from external business systems and represent the standard terminal users of the OpenIM system. The `ex` field is an extension field for business use.

### APP Administrator

- **Permissions**: Superuser privileges.
- **Purpose**: The APP Administrator can invoke the REST API to directly operate the OpenIM system.
- **Built-in Administrator**: The OpenIM server has a built-in APP Administrator with the `userID` of **imAdmin**.

### Notification Account

- **Function**: APP Administrators can send notification messages as a system notification account, which bypasses friend relationships and group permissions. Notification accounts can be added through the REST API, and their nickname and avatar can be modified.
- **User Experience**: When users receive messages, the messages will be displayed with the notification account's avatar and nickname in the conversation.

## Groups

In the OpenIM system, the group functionality includes the following aspects:

### Group Types

- **Single Group Type**: The current system supports only one type of group, without differentiating between small or large groups.

### Group Member Limits

- **Member Limit**: There is no restriction on the number of group members, with a maximum of **100,000** members supported.

### Methods for Joining Groups

Users can join a group through one of the following three methods:

1. **Group Member Invitation**: Existing group members can invite new members to join the group directly.
2. **Send Join Request**: Users must submit a request and wait for approval from the group owner or administrator to join.
3. **Allow Anyone to Join**: Any user can freely join the group without approval.

### Group Roles and Permissions

There are three roles in a group, with decreasing levels of permissions:

1. **Group Owner**
2. **Administrator**
3. **Regular Member**

#### Group Owner

- **Permissions**: The highest level of permissions.
- **Management Functions**:
  - Set multiple administrators, all of whom have the same permissions.
  - Dissolve the group.
  - Transfer ownership to another group member.
  - Must transfer ownership before leaving the group.
  - Handle group join requests.
  - Manage group settings, such as group announcements and group name.

#### Administrator

- **Permissions**: Same as other administrators, subordinate to the group owner.
- **Management Functions**:
  - Handle group join requests.
  - Manage group settings, such as group announcements and group name.
  - Perform management tasks on regular members, such as kicking out members or muting them.

#### Regular Member

- **Permissions**: Basic group usage permissions.
- **Functions**: Participate in group chats, view group announcements, send messages, etc.

### Permissions Management

- **High-Permission Role Operations**: Group owners and administrators can perform operations on lower-permission roles, such as kicking members out or muting them.
- **Equal Permissions Among Administrators**: Administrators have equal permissions and do not have a hierarchical relationship.

### Group Owner and Administrator Management Functions

- **Handle Join Requests**: Group owners and administrators can review and handle user join requests.
- **Group Settings Management**: Includes editing group announcements, changing group names, etc.

## Messages and Notifications

### Messages

- **Definition**: A message refers to the actual content sent by a user or the system, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia forms.
- **Functions**:
  - **Content Transmission**: Transmits message content to the receiver.
  - **Display and Presentation**: Ensures that the message content is clearly displayed on the receiving end so that the user can understand and view it.

### Notifications

- **Definition**: A notification refers to an action triggered by a user or system and sent to the relevant parties in the form of a notification.
- **Uses**:
  - **System Synchronization**: Used to synchronize system states or actions, such as group member synchronization or friend list synchronization.
  - **Information Display**: Used to display important events or action results to users, such as join group notifications or system announcements.

## Message Push

### Online Push

- **Definition**: When the user is online, OpenIM prioritizes using its own long connection channel for message push. This is called online push.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **High Real-time**: Messages are delivered to the recipient immediately.
  - **Stability**: Relies on the long connection channel, ensuring message transmission reliability.

### Offline Push

- **Definition**: When the user is offline, or if the app is killed, OpenIM cannot push messages through the long connection and must use a third-party push service.
- **Implementation Methods**:
  - **Vendor Push**: Uses push services from vendors such as APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) to deliver messages.
  - **In Mainland China**: Generally uses **GeTui** service.
  - **Outside China**: Generally uses **Firebase** service.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Wide Coverage**: Suitable for various network environments, ensuring that messages are received when the user comes online again.

## Message Storage Types

### Local Messages

- Apart from the JS SDK, OpenIM stores messages locally as needed. For messages already fetched by the client, the system stores them locally, collectively called **"Local Messages"** üóÑÔ∏è.

### Multi-Device Sync Messages

- Users often use multiple devices. When a message is sent from device A, it will be synced to device B. These messages are called **"Multi-Device Sync Messages"** üîÑ.

### Offline Messages

- Messages received while the user is offline are called **"Offline Messages"** üì©. The system will sync these messages when the user logs back in.

### Roaming Messages

- When the user switches devices or reinstalls the app, the system will fetch and sync these historical messages. These messages are referred to as **"Roaming Messages"** üåç.
