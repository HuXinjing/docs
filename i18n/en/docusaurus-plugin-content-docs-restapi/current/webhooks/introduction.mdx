# 📞 Callback Description

📢 **OpenIM** offers powerful callback functionalities. When a specific event happens before or after a process, OpenIMServer proactively sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the APP’s business server. This allows the APP’s business server to intervene in the subsequent processing of that event or to perform data synchronization based on the callback.

## 📑 Callback Classification

Callbacks are divided into two main types based on the timing of their processing:

	•	🚫 **Callbacks Before the Event Occurs**: These “before” type callbacks allow the APP’s business server to intervene in the event handling process. For example, you can implement sensitive word filtering for messages. OpenIMServer determines subsequent steps based on the callback response.
	•	📤 **Notifications After the Event Occurs**: These “after” type callbacks are mainly used to notify the APP’s business server for data synchronization. For example, when a user joins a group. In this case, OpenIMServer ignores the callback’s return values and error codes.

## ⚙️ Configuration Description

```yaml
url: http://127.0.0.1:10006/callbackExample
beforeSendSingleMsg:
  enable: false
  timeout: 5
  failedContinue: true
```

	•	url: The APP business server callback address, supports HTTP/HTTPS
	•	enable: Whether to enable the callback, true for enable
	•	timeout: Response timeout in seconds
	•	failedContinue: Whether to continue the process if the callback times out or if the API fails. Generally effective for before type callbacks. true means to continue execution.

## 🔄 Callback Protocol

**OpenIMServer** uses a third-party callback mechanism based on HTTP/HTTPS protocol. When initiating a callback request, OpenIMServer sends a POST request to notify the APP’s business server. The specifics of these requests are directly included in the request body.

### Sample Request URL

```plaintext
{WEBHOOK_ADDRESS}/callbackCommand?contenttype=json
```
